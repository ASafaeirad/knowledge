An amygdala hijack occurs when the brain's emotional center (the amygdala), overrides the rational thinking part (the prefrontal cortex) in response to a perceived threat or stressor. This results in an intense emotional reaction that feels automatic and often disproportionate to the situation.

## Signs of Amygdala Hijack:
- Sudden outbursts or panic
- Inability to think clearly
- Later regret about actions taken in the moment
