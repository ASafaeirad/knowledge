The representativeness heuristic occurs when we estimate the probability of an event based on how similar it is to a known situation. In other words, we compare it to a situation, prototype, or stereotype we already have in mind.
## Conjunction fallacy
The **conjunction fallacy** (also known as the **Linda problem**) is an inference that a [conjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction "Logical conjunction") set of two or more specific conclusions is likelier than any single member of that same set, in violation of the laws of probability. It is a type of [formal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy "Formal fallacy").
