Empathy is the capacity to understand and share another person's emotional state. It is foundational to emotional intelligence and effective collaboration. Empathy isn’t about agreeing—it’s about understanding.

## Types of Empathy

* **Cognitive Empathy**: The ability to understand another’s perspective or mental state -> **Understand**
* **Emotional Empathy**: The capacity to physically feel what another person feels -> **Feel**
* **Compassionate Empathy**: Going beyond understanding and feeling—to take action to help -> **Act**

## Empathy is critical for:

* Building trust and rapport
* Conflict de-escalation
* Active listening and inclusive dialogue
* Avoiding harmful assumptions or bias

> Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. – _Alfred Adler_

## Empathy Burnout

While empathy is powerful, excessive emotional empathy—especially in caregiving or high-emotion roles—can lead to empathy fatigue or burnout.

Ways to prevent this:
* Set emotional boundaries
* Shift from emotional to compassionate empathy
* Build regulation skills and reflective practices
