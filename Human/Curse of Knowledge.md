The curse of knowledge, also called the curse of expertise or expert's curse, is a cognitive bias that occurs when a person who has specialized knowledge assumes that others share in that knowledge.


A 1990 experiment by a [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University") graduate student, Elizabeth Newton, illustrated the curse of knowledge in the results of a simple task. A group of subjects were asked to "tap" out well known songs with their fingers, while another group tried to name the melodies. When the "tappers" were asked to predict how many of the "tapped" songs would be recognized by listeners, they would always overestimate. The curse of knowledge is demonstrated here as the "tappers" are so familiar with what they were tapping that they assumed listeners would easily recognize the tune.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge#cite_note-11)
