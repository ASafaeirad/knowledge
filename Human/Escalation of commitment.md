The feeling that our future behaviors must align with what we have said and done in the past severely compromises our ability to make good decisions. This is especially true when our past choices have led to unfavorable outcomes.

While it goes against our best interest, we often engage in an irrational escalation of commitment, meaning we continue investing our time or resources into something despite facing increasingly negative outcomes.
