This study explores how reliance on external assistance, such as searching for information online or seeking help, can lead to overconfidence in one's abilities. The researchers demonstrate that immediate access to external help causes people to overestimate their knowledge or skills. Conversely, when external assistance is delayed or requires active effort to access, individuals are more likely to have an accurate assessment of their capabilities.

### Experimental Design
The researchers used [[cognitive]] tasks where participants needed to solve problems or answer questions. The tasks varied across the experiments but generally focused on:

- **Semantic Memory:** General knowledge or facts.
- **Episodic Memory:** Recollection of specific events or personal experiences.
- **Problem-Solving:** Logical or analytical challenges.

Each task was designed to measure the participants' ability to:
- Perform without assistance.
- Evaluate their own knowledge or skill level.

### Conditions of Assistance
The key manipulation was the **type and timing of external assistance** provided:
- **Immediate Assistance:** Participants had access to help (e.g., online search tools) as soon as they faced a question or task.
- **Delayed Assistance:** Participants could only access help after a specific time delay.
- **Active Choice:** Participants had to decide whether to seek help, requiring conscious reflection on whether they needed it.

###  Measurements

The study measured:
1. **Performance Accuracy:** Whether participants answered correctly or solved problems successfully.
2. **Confidence Ratings:** After each task, participants rated their confidence in the correctness of their answers.
3. **Perceived Knowledge or Ability:** Participants self-assessed their overall competence in the domain of the tasks.

### Key Observations
- **Immediate Access:**  
    Participants with instant help believed they were more skilled, even when their performance depended on the assistance.
- **Delayed Access:**  
    Waiting before receiving help reduced overconfidence, as participants spent more time reflecting on their true abilities.
- **Active Choice:**  
    When participants had to consciously decide to seek help, their confidence levels aligned more closely with their actual performance.
