### **What is Humblebragging?**

Humblebragging refers to statements that appear modest, self-critical, or even self-deprecating on the surface but actually serve to draw attention to one's accomplishments or positive qualities. For example:

- "I can’t believe I won the award; there were so many better candidates."
- "Ugh, my phone keeps buzzing nonstop with all these job offers."

### **Why Do People Humblebrag?**

* **Social approval**: People use humblebragging to appear relatable or modest while still showcasing achievements or desirable traits.
* **Cultural norms**: In some cultures or contexts, direct bragging may be frowned upon, leading individuals to mask their pride in humility.
* **Self-promotion**: It’s a strategy to gain attention or admiration without seeming overly boastful.
###  **How Does Humblebragging Affect Others?**

- **Negative perceptions:** Studies show that humblebragging often backfires. It can make people appear insincere, manipulative, or even annoying.
- **Trust issues:** If others sense the lack of authenticity, they may find it harder to trust the humblebragger.
- **Reduced likability:** Genuine humility is often preferred over humblebragging, which can come across as a lack of self-awareness.
### **Advice from the Video**

The speaker emphasizes the value of authenticity:

1. **Be straightforward:** If you need to share an accomplishment, do it directly rather than cloaking it in false modesty.
2. **Embrace vulnerability:** People are more likely to connect with genuine expressions of pride or humility.
3. **Practice self-awareness:** Reflect on why you feel the need to humblebrag and consider more constructive ways to express yourself.
