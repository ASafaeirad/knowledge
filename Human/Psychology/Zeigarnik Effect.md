The human brain tends to remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed ones.

> The urgent ends up drawing attention away from the important.

## What to do?
- **Own less stuff**: the more we own, the more energy, the more energy and attention are things require
- **One minute rule**: if something take less than a minute to complete, do it.
- **Create routines**: incorporate project completion into your daily or even weekly routine. (you don't need to think about them)
- **Break your large jobs into smaller tasks** so you can have completion feeling.


## Memory Advantage:
Research consistently shows that interrupted tasks are more readily recalled than those that have been completed. One study found unfinished tasks were recalled 90% more often than finished ones. 
### First experiment:
People worked on some tricky word problems. Halfway through some problems, they were told to stop (interrupted). Other problems they got to finish.
- In this case, they remembered the finished ones better.
- But maybe that’s because they didn’t get much time on the interrupted ones.
### Second experiment:
People got to work on all the problems for the same amount of time. If they got stuck, they could give up on their own.
- Now they remembered the unfinished problems better.
-  This suggests it's not just stopping a task that makes it memorable, it’s the feeling of being stuck that helps your brain remember it later.
## Distraction and Goal Pursuit:
Research suggests that unfinished goals can create distracting thoughts and negatively impact the pursuit of new goals

## User Interface Design
Features like progress bars in applications can leverage the Zeigarnik effect to motivate users to complete tasks.

## Note taking
- **Note-taking** is proven to improve memory via deeper processing.
- **Zeigarnik effect** shows that incomplete mental “loops” boost memory retention.
- Taken together, it’s plausible that **note-taking creates external open loops**, which could enhance recall in a Zeigarnik-like way (Research gap).
