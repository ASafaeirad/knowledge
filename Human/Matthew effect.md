The Matthew effect refers to the phenomenon where individuals or entities that possess certain advantages—such as wealth, fame, or knowledge—tend to accumulate more of these advantages over time, thereby widening the gap between themselves and those less advantaged.

It encapsulates the principle of "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer".
