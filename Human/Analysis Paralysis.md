Analysis paralysis (or paralysis by analysis) **describes an individual or group process where overanalyzing or overthinking a situation can cause forward motion or decision-making to become "paralyzed"**, meaning that no solution or course of action is decided upon within a natural time frame.

## Analysis paralysis in action

In 2000, psychologists Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper published a study about consumer decision making. On two separate days, they offered a display table of different jams that a consumer could buy: one day with a variety of 24 different jams, and the other day with only six different types of jams. Iyengar and Lepper discovered that consumers were approximately 10 times more likely to purchase from the table with only six options in comparison to the table with 24 options. 

## Solutions

1. **Set yourself a deadline to make a decision.** If you have no timeline for when a decision needs to be made, you can spend a large amount of time waffling back and forth between different options, and ultimately never making a decision. The best course of action? Set yourself a deadline or a specific time frame for when the decision needs to be made. 
    
2. **Narrow down your options early.** If you have an overwhelming amount of options, get rid of some right away. Figure out what you want your expected outcome of this decision to be, and then eliminate any options that don’t fit the qualifications of that outcome. 
    
3. **Practice making decisions quickly**. Impulsivity isn’t always a bad thing. If you are constantly plagued by analysis paralysis, practice making small decisions fast. The inconsequential things like deciding where to eat dinner or what path you take to get to work will help you be more decisive when you’re making bigger decisions. 
    
4. **Use a framework for your decision making process**: Believe it or not, there is a whole framework for the decision making process. Following a step-by-step guide can help take away some of the cognitive heavy work that’s required to make a big decision.
