Cortical blindness, also known as cerebral blindness or cortical visual impairment, is a neurological condition where vision is lost due to damage in the occipital cortex of the brain, the part responsible for processing visual information, rather than in the eyes themselves.

This means the eyes are typically normal, and the condition can range from partial visual field deficits to complete blindness.

Some individuals with cortical blindness can still process emotional information, particularly from facial expressions and eye contact, as the [[Amygdala]], can still be activated in the absence of the visual cortex.
