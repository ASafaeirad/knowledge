The term "maturity" derives from the Latin word "maturitas" indicating the state or quality of being mature. In its most general sense, maturity refers to the state of being fully developed or complete, whether in a physical, emotional, intellectual, or social context. The meaning can vary widely depending on the specific area it is applied to, such as biological maturity, psychological maturity, or even financial maturity.
