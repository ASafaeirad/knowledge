Hey folks,

Having been a part of the Estateguru family for over two years, I've had the chance of working in different teams and collaborating with a many talented people. This journey has been a treasure of learning experiences, and today, I'd like to share some insights that have learned in this jurney.

First and foremost, I'd want to thank a fantastic leader, @Ararat. His leadership has taught me the importance of fostering a sense of "ownership" among team members via trust and room for impact. I observed how it could maintain drive and inspiration in others.

As Steve Jobs once remarked, "It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do." While I believe that the essence of the message is: "It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and dictate HOW they should do things.". For experienced professionals to truly thrive and feel valued, they need to sense their impact and take ownership of their project.


Another great thing I've learned from Estateguru is while we may transfer responsibility and accountability, we cannot force ownership. People accept it as an innate feeling. Our responsibility as leaders and teammates is to cultivate an environment in which team members feel empowered to take ownership.

Holding someone accountable without establishing trust is like to putting gasoline into a coal box and not lighting it. Instead of boosting drive, it causes emotions of overload and abuse.
