The Double Diamond is a visual model to understand  the process of design using [[3 Modes Of Thinking|Divergent and Convergent thinking]]. Its near-universal appeal arises from its simple focus on both the problem and solution.

- **Discover**: Understand the issue rather than merely assuming what it is. This phase involves speaking to and spending time with people who are affected by the issues.
    - Purpose: Understand the problem.
    - Activities: User research, market analysis, observation, interviews.
    - Goal: Gather insights, explore broadly.
	
- **Define**: With insight gathered from the discovery phase, define the challenge in a different way.
    - Purpose: Define the real problem to solve.
    - Activities: Synthesize research, identify patterns, create problem statements.
    - Goal: Narrow down to a clear and actionable challenge.
	
- **Develop**: Give different answers to the clearly defined problem, seeking inspiration from elsewhere and co-designing with a range of different people.
    - Purpose: Explore possible solutions.
    - Activities: Brainstorming, prototyping, co-creation, testing.
    - Goal: Generate and test multiple ideas.
	
- **Deliver**: Test different solutions at a small scale. Reject those that will not work and improve the ones that will.
    - Purpose: Finalize and implement the solution.
    - Activities: Refine, test, launch, measure.
    - Goal: Deliver a validated and effective solution.
