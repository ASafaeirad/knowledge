Dual-track agile is an agile methodology that contains two separate tracks. Thereâ€™s the **Discovery** track, and the **Delivery** track.

**Discovery track**: Focuses on producing, testing, and validating product ideas.
**Delivery track**: Works on turning those ideas into an actual product. 


## Discovery track
Here at product board, we spend a lot of time making sure we understand exactly what we should be building for our users. You can use [[Double Diamond]] for conducting product discovery, structured as follows:

### Identify the challenge
- Understand
- Define
## Re-frame the problem
- Ideate
- Prototype
- Test
### The delivery track
This track takes the learnings that the discovery track uncovered and applies them to the finished product. The aim of the delivery track is to build and release as many useful features and improvements as possible in a sprint.
