## Finding Your Strengths

Your strengths are your unique talents, abilities, and qualities that come naturally to you.

By identifying and understanding these strengths, you can leverage them to achieve greater success and fulfillment.

Focus on strengths rather than weaknesses.

The CliftonStrengths assessment, which is available online, is a key tool introduced in this section. It is a comprehensive assessment that consists of a series of questions designed to identify your dominant strengths. The assessment measures your responses against the 34 possible themes and provides you with a personalized report outlining your top five strengths.
