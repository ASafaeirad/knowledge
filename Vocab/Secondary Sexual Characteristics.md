A secondary sex characteristic is a physical characteristic of an organism that is related to or derived from its sex, but not directly part of its reproductive system. In humans, these characteristics typically start to appear during puberty, and include enlarged breasts and widened hips of females, facial hair and Adam's apples on males, and pubic hair on both.
 
In non-human animals, they can start to appear at sexual maturity. It include, for example, the manes of male lions, the bright facial and rump coloration of male mandrills, and horns in many goats and antelopes.
