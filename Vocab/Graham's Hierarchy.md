## Name calling
The lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most common.

## Ad hominem
Attacks the characteristics or authority of the writer without addressing the substance of the argument.

## Responding to Tone
Criticizes the tone of the writing without addressing the substance of the argument.

> Science is interesting, and if you don’t agree you can f*** off.

## Contradiction
States the opposing case with little or no supporting evidence.

> Palin: Argument is an intellectual process. Contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says.
  Cleese: No it isn’t.

## Counterargument
Contradicts and then backs it up with reasoning and/or supporting evidence.

## Refutation
Finds the mistake and then explains why it’s mistaken using quotes.

## Refuting the Central Point
Explicitly refutes the central point.
