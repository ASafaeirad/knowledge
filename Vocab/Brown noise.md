Brown noise, also known as [[Browninan Motion|Brownian]] noise or red noise, is a type of sound signal that has a power density which decreases with increasing frequency, resulting in a lower-pitched and deeper sound compared to white noise or pink noise. This type of noise mimics the random motion observed in Brownian motion, which is the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid.
