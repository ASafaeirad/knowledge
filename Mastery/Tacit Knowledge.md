Tacit or implicit knowledge (as opposed to [[Explicit Knowledge]]]) is [[Knowledge]] that is difficult to express or extract; therefore it is more difficult to transfer to others by means of writing it down or verbalizing it.

For example ability to swim, play an instrument, or speak a language is a tacit knowledge.
