Psychological safety is the shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. Coined by Amy Edmondson, it means that team members feel accepted and respected enough to speak up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes without fear of embarrassment or punishment.

> Psychological safety is not at odds with having tough conversations. It is what allows us to have tough conversations. â€“ _Amy Edmondson_
