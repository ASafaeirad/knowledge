## Get Natural Light in your eyes within 1-hour of waking up
If you wake up before the sun, turn on a bunch of bright lights and then get sunlight in your eyes once it comes out.

**Reasons**: 
1. It modulates the timing of what's called [[Cortisol Pulse]] once every 24 hours you're going to get a boost in Cortisol it's a healthy boost it sets your temperature rhythm in motion, set your level of alertness, your level of focus and your mood.
2. If you start your morning with artificial light  and go outside around noon, your are in what's called the [[Circadian dead zone]] which shift your Cortisol pulse late and that's a signature of [[Depression]] and [[Anxiety]] and difficulty falling asleep.
3. Indirect rays from the sun triggers these [[Melanopsin ganglion cells]] cells in the eyes, these cells send a signal to our [[Hypothalamus]] and it release the [[Peptide]] which is a wake-up signal for your whole brain and body and sets a timer for the onset of [[Melatonin]] release 16 hours later.
4. The signal to [[Hypothalamus]] also release of the [[Neuromodulator]] [[Dopamine]], Dopamine is a molecule from which [[Adrenaline]] and [[Epinephrine]] is manufactured.
6. It turns out that [[UBV]] from the sunlight to the skin actually has a route involving a molecule called [[P53]] and the [[Keratinocytes]] which is is process that releases [[Dopamine]]. According to a study, those who spent 20 to 30 minutes in the sun three times each week experienced significantly higher measured levels of both [[estrogen]] and [[testosterone]] in both men and women.
