# Practices
## Get Natural Light in your eyes within 1-hour of waking up
If you wake up before the sun, turn on a bunch of bright lights and then get sunlight in your eyes once it comes out.

**Reasons**: 
1. It modulates the timing of what's called [[Cortisol Pulse]] once every 24 hours you're going to get a boost in Cortisol it's a healthy boost it sets your temperature rhythm in motion, set your level of alertness, your level of focus and your mood.
2. If you start your morning with artificial light  and go outside around noon, your are in what's called the [[Circadian dead zone]] which shift your Cortisol pulse late and that's a signature of [[Depression]] and [[Anxiety]] and difficulty falling asleep.
3. Indirect rays from the sun triggers these [[Melanopsin ganglion cells]] cells in the eyes, these cells send a signal to our [[Hypothalamus]] and it release the [[Peptide]] which is a wake-up signal for your whole brain and body and sets a timer for the onset of [[Melatonin]] release 16 hours later.
4. The signal to [[Hypothalamus]] also release of the [[Neuromodulator]] [[Dopamine]], Dopamine is a molecule from which [[Adrenaline]] and [[Epinephrine]] is manufactured.
6. It turns out that [[UBV]] from the sunlight to the skin actually has a route involving a molecule called [[P53]] and the [[Keratinocytes]] which is is process that releases [[Dopamine]]. According to a study, those who spent 20 to 30 minutes in the sun three times each week experienced significantly higher measured levels of both [[Estrogen]] and [[Testosterone]] in both men and women.

## Adenosine

The longer we are awake the longer the buildup of something called [[Adenosine]] in the brain and body.

Adenosine turns on the [[Parasympathetic Nervous System]] suppresses the [[Sympathetic Nervous System]].

Adenosine is pushed back down when we are When we sleep Also in the sleepy state of early morning

[[Caffeine]] effectively blocks the effect of Adenosine, If you wake up in the morning and you didn't sleep quite as much as you would have liked
, that means you are sleepy and you have buildup of Adenosine in your system.
If you immediately react for caffeine, you suppress the action of Adenosine and you will be more alert, But then the caffeine wears off and the Adenosine binds to the receptors with greater affinity. So a better practice is to delay the intake of caffeine by 60-90 minutes after waken and allow the Adenosine to be cleared out.

Exercise also can clear out the Adenosine.

## Temperature

2 Hours before body wake-up cycle, the body temperature is in its lowest temperature, we wake up because of increasing the core body temperature. Increasing core body temperature triggers the increasing [[Cortisol]].

Viewing the light at the same time you en-train your body that is going to happen at the same time the next day, the clocks of your body are matched to this cortisol pulse.

When your body reaches the temperature maximum (on 3 P.M) you might be sleepy on that time, and then it starts to drop and you get sleepy, so make sure you keep your room cool for sleeping.

The goal is increase the body temperature when you want to be awake and decrease it when you want to sleep.
