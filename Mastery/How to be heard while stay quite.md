1. Speak with your hands, eye contact, mid sentence pauses
2. Give praise to others
3. The best way to earn respect: Take credit for everything you're involved in.
4. By sharing the praise with others you earn respect for your achievement and humility.
5. Relaxed and confident body language

## Sit with confidence:
- Lean back
- Sit asymmetrically
- Take up the unoccupied space around you

## Be non reactive
- Not reacting is all it takes to look confident.

## Laugh works
What ever this is I’m facing, I know with certainty I’ll be fine.
