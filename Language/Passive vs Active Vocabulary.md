In general there are two different categories for all the words we learn, they are either passive or active.

## Active words:
All the words we know and we can use them when we are communicating.

## Passive words:
All the words that you have learned before, and if you read them or hear them, you know what they mean. However, when you want to communicate you can't use them.

Many language learners are learning many passive words.

It's not about the number of words you know it's about being passive or active.

## How can we activate the passive vocabulary:

1. **Have a personal dictionary:** Don't stop here if you need active vocabulary.
2. **Write two or three sentences with the new word:** we need to learn the word in context, as it can have several meanings and different uses.
3. **Write down some [[Collocation|collocations]] with that word**
4. **Write a paragraph with the word that you have learned and it's collocations**
