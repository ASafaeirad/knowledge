## Overview
It is a philosophy of personal [virtue ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics) informed by its system of [[logic]] and its views on the natural world, asserting that the practice of virtue is both necessary and sufficient to achieve [[Eudaimonia]].

The Stoics identified the path to [[Eudaimonia]] with a life spent practicing the [cardinal virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues) and living in accordance with nature.

The Stoic philosopher Epictetus starts his work the Enchiridion with the fundamental tenet of Stoicism.


همه فرایند های طبیعی، مانند بیماری و سلامتی، تابع قوانین ناگسستنی طبیعت هستند.
بنابراین انسان باید یاد بگیرد که سرنوشت خود را بپذیرد چرا که هیچ چیز به طور تصادفی اتفاق نمی افتد و همه چیز از روی ضرورت اتفاق می افتد.
زمانی که سرنوشت برسد شکایت کردن دیگر فایده ای ندارد
انسان باید رویداد های خوب زندگی را بدون نگرانی بپذیرد.

The core of Stoicism is the very definition of acceptance and indifference.

## The Power of Indifference

From the human perspective two categories can be distinguished:
* Things that we do not control.
* Things that we do control.

Although we don't have much control over what happens to us, we do have control of how it affects us, and must use this control to great effect.

There is nothing we can do to exclude misfortune.
We should focus on the things within our control and have a contempt for the things not in our control

There are still aspect of our life that are up to us:
* The position we take towards the world around us.

Stoicism points to life in accordance with nature.
We shouldn't act against the natural course of thing but embrace it.

Emotion is a human characteristic that can be trumped by reason.
It's not the emotion that decides our mood but the position we take towards the emotion.

## [[Amor Fati]]
It means loving your fate.

> My formula for human greatness is Amor Fat: That one wants nothing to be different, not in the future, not in the past, not for all eternity.
  Not only to endure what is necessary, still less to conceal it - All idealism is falseness in the face of necessity - but to love it.
> - Nietzsche

Anxious people has control freak, freak of simply cannot handle insecurity, therefore they generate anxiety because the anxious mind cannot figure out what the future will bring, but keeps trying anyway.
Stoic people fully embrace fate no matter what.

Amor Fati, means you make the best out of every moment, and work toward your goals, give them everything, but when the result is turn out to be different than you expected, fully embrace and accept your fate.

Amor Fati put you in a position which you simply can't go wrong and when things can go wrong, there's noting to worry about.

Embrace your destiny, no matter what, and you'll have nothing to fear.

## [[Memento Mori]]
Life is temporary, don't waste time on trivial things.

## The View From Above
See our self from the cosmic point of view, so we realize how small and unimportant we are compared to the vastness of the universe.

## 10 Ways to Be More Stoic:
01. Transform everyone into a teacher.
02. Say no to the easy way, seek out challenges. 
03. Be strict with yourself but tolerant of others. 
04. Allow the journey to be the thing.
05. Transform envy into emulation. 
06. Stand on the shoulders of giants.
07. Forgive yourself and forgive others.
08. Fall in love with Fate.
09. Always practice courage, temperance, and humor.
10. Remember, the obstacle is the path.

## Summary
That indifference is a power the Stoics know very well, life is short and that's why it's important to point our life energy towards essential and important things and leave unimportant things be.
