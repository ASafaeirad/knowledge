Abduction refers to a type of reasoning often called inference to the **best explanation**.
Here’s the idea:
- You observe a surprising fact or phenomenon.
- You consider possible explanations.
- You tentatively accept the explanation that would best account for the observation.

It’s different from:

**Deduction**: where conclusions necessarily follow from premises.
**Induction**: where you generalize from repeated cases.
