The fact–value distinction is a fundamental [[Epistemology|[epistemological]] distinction described between:

- **Statements of fact** (positive or descriptive statements), which are based upon reason and observation, and examined via the empirical method.
- **Statements of value** (normative or prescriptive statements), which encompass ethics and aesthetics, and are studied via axiology.

The fact–value distinction is closely related to, and derived from, the [[is–ought problem]] in [[Morality]] [[philosophy]], characterized by David Hume. The terms are often used interchangeably, though philosophical discourse concerning the is–ought problem does not usually encompass aesthetics.
