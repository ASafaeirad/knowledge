Amor fati is a Latin phrase that may be translated as "love of fate". It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including suffering and loss, as good or, at the very least, necessary.

What ever you do in your life as long as you embrace the outcome you'll be fine.
Goals and ambitions are fine as long as you remain detached from the outcome.
