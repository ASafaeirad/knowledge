Align your actions with nature and not forcing anything, and acting when it's suitable.

Acting out of turn, means going against the flow of the game.

> When you arrive at non-action, nothing will be left undone. Mastery of the world is achieved by letting things take their natural course.”

> The Tao never acts with force, yet there is nothing that it can not do.
