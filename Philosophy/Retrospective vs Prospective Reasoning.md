he difference between **prospective** and **retrospective reasoning** comes down to the **direction of your thought process in relation to time**.

## Prospective:
Reasoning based on what _might_ happen in the future. *What could happen*
> “If I cook dinner now, I’ll have more free time later tonight.”

## Retrospective:
Reasoning based on what _has already_ happened. *What did happen, and why*
> “I didn’t have time to relax last night because I started cooking too late.”
