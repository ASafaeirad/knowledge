The is–ought problem, as articulated by the Scottish philosopher and historian David Hume, arises when one makes claims about what ought to be that are based solely on statements about what is.

Hume found that there seems to be a significant difference between descriptive statements (about what is) and prescriptive statements (about what ought to be), and that it is not obvious how one can coherently transition from descriptive statements to prescriptive ones.

Hume's law or Hume's guillotine is the **thesis that an ethical or judgmental conclusion cannot be inferred from purely descriptive factual statements**.

The is–ought problem is closely related to the [[Fact–value distinction]] in [[epistemology]]. Though the terms are often used interchangeably, academic discourse concerning the latter may encompass aesthetics in addition to [[ethics]].
