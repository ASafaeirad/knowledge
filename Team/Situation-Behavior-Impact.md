SBI is a tool that works best for giving negative feedback as it can make the recipient less defensive about it, but it can absolutely be used for positive feedback, too.
- Situation: Time and Place
- Behavior: What did you see or hear
- Impact: How did it impact ME personally
+ Intent (Extra): Sometimes, you may want to ask what the intention was behind their behavior. They might have a sound reason that you don't know about or is different from your assumptions.
## Example
Let's see what giving feedback using this tool can look like. Imagine a manager talking to their report after a recent meeting.

They start with the situation: "In yesterday's product review meeting, when you were giving an update for your team..."

Then they describe their report's behavior: "...you didn't share any recent learnings about how our customers use this new feature..."

And share the impact the behavior had: "...which made me worry if you've been talking to our customers recently at all."

Finally, they ask about their intent: "Why didn't you share anything this time?"

This can continue with the discussion about the gap between the intent and the impact.
