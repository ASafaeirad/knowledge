![[Tuckman Model.png]]
Tuckman’s model outlines five distinct stages that teams typically progress through:

**Forming:** Getting Started
**Storming:** Dealing with Conflicts
**Norming:** Working Together Better
**Performing:** Working at Their Best
**Adjourning:** Wrapping Things Up

---
## Forming
The forming stage kicks in when you put together a team to work on a new project, and typically involves team members who may not have worked together in the past.


What you will see in this stage:
- What you will see in this stage:
- People are polite but cautious
- Team members unsure about their goals
- Your team is looking to you for guidance

What you can do:
- Set clear goals so your team members know what is expected of them
- Help team members get to know each other
- Give clear instructions on tasks to avoid confusion
---
## Storming
The storming stage follows the forming stage, and can be tough.

What you will see in this stage:
- Arguments and conflicts between team members
- Power struggles and in-fighting
- Some resistance to tasks being assigned

What you can do:
- Encourage open and honest communication by developing trust
- Help mine for and resolve conflicts
- Offer support and guidance, and remind everyone in the team of the shared goals
---
## Norming
In the norming stage, team members start to resolve their differences and work together more smoothly.

What you will see in this stage:
- Higher trust, and better teamwork
- Everyone in the team falling into a ‘routine’ that they follow as part of their roles
- More open, honest communication

What you can do:
- Empower the team to lead the project by stepping back a bit and observing
- Celebrate team achievements and intermediate milestones
- Continue to reinforce team goals, and mine for hidden conflicts
---
## Adjourning
Every project comes to an end at some point. The final stage of a project is adjourning, in which the team is disbanded so the team members can then be reassigned to other projects.

**What you will see in this stage**
- Mixed feelings (pride in what they’ve done, but sad it’s ending)
- Lots of reflections and retrospectives
- Celebrating the project’s completion

**What you can do**
- Celebrate what the team has achieved, announce any special awards
- Make sure project knowledge is recorded for the future
- Work with team members on their next project assignments
