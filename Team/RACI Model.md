[What is the RACI Model?](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/raci-model/)

- **Responsible:** a manager or team member who is directly responsible for successfully completing a project task.
- **Accountable:** the person with final authority over the successful completion of the specific task or deliverable.
- **Consulted:** someone with unique insights the team will consult.
- **Informed:** a client or executive who isn’t directly involved, but you should keep up to speed.
