# Divergent Thinking
**AKA**: Creative Thinking, Horizontal Thinking

Divergent thinking is a thought process or method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. It is often used in conjunction with its cognitive colleague, convergent thinking, which follows a particular set of logical steps to arrive at one solution, which in some cases is a "correct" solution. By contrast, divergent thinking typically occurs in a spontaneous, free-flowing, 

## Convergent thinking
**AKA:** [[Critical Thinking]], Vertical Thinking, Analytical Thinking, Linear Thinking

Generally means the ability to give the "correct" answer to standard questions that do not require significant creativity, for instance in most tasks in school and on standardized multiple-choice tests for intelligence.

Convergent thinking is the type of thinking that focuses on coming up with the single, well-established answer to a problem

Some issues that need Convergent thinking:
* Solving a simple mathematical equation
* Finding the shortest route between two points on a map
* Diagnosing a medical condition based on symptoms
* Identifying the cause of a device’s technical malfunction

# Lateral Thinking
**AKA**: Thinking Outside the Box

Lateral thinking is solving problems through an indirect and creative approach, using reasoning that is not immediately obvious and involving ideas that may not be obtainable by using only traditional step-by-step logic.
